# Lekker Tours Web

Public website and admin dashboard for **Lekker Tours and Travel**, a Nairobi-based safari operator.

The backend it reads from lives in a separate repository: **`lekker-tours-api`** (Express 5 +
MongoDB). That service must be running for this app to show content.

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4)
- **Default port:** `3000`

| | URL |
|---|---|
| Public website | http://localhost:3000 |
| **Admin dashboard** | **http://localhost:3000/admin** |
| Admin login | http://localhost:3000/admin/login |

The admin area appears in no public navigation, is marked `noindex, nofollow`, and is disallowed in
`robots.txt`. It is reachable only by typing the URL.

---

## Getting started

Start the API first — see the `lekker-tours-api` README. Then:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local    # then edit it — see below
npm run dev                   # starts the site on :3000
```

Sign in at `/admin/login` with the administrator created by the API's `npm run seed:admin`.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev     # development server
npm run build   # production build
npm start       # production server
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. `.env.local` is gitignored and must never be committed.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Base URL of the API. Default `http://localhost:4000`. Public — it reaches the browser. Also feeds `images.remotePatterns`, so uploaded images render. Keep it identical to `PUBLIC_API_URL` in the API repo. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | This site's own public URL. Used for canonical URLs, `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts`. |
| `REVALIDATE_SECRET` | Shared secret for the webhook the API calls. Must match the value in `lekker-tours-api`. **Server-only** — never prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. |

---

## How it talks to the API

There is no shared code with the API repo — only HTTP.

**Reading content.** Public pages are **server components** that fetch through
[src/lib/api.ts](src/lib/api.ts) with an explicit `next: { revalidate, tags }`. Next 15 does not
cache `fetch` by default, so this is deliberate rather than incidental; without it every render
would hit Express. Public reads use `apiGetSafe` / `apiListSafe`, which degrade to an empty state
and log rather than crashing the page when the API is unreachable.

**Cache invalidation.** After any admin write, the API POSTs the affected cache tags to
[/api/revalidate](src/app/api/revalidate/route.ts), which verifies `x-revalidate-secret` and calls
`revalidateTag` for each, so published changes appear without a restart.

**The admin dashboard** fetches **client-side** with `credentials: 'include'` and
`cache: 'no-store'`, so it always shows the true database state including drafts. The JWT lives in
an `httpOnly` cookie and is never decoded in the browser — only the API verifies it.

> **Next 15, not 16.** `revalidateTag()` takes a *single* argument here. The two-argument form,
> `updateTag()` and `cacheLife()` are Next 16 APIs and will throw. Next is pinned to **15.5.25**;
> note that Next 16 is the current major release.

## Admin dashboard

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Counts per collection, unread enquiry badge, quick actions. |
| **Tours** | Full CRUD. Day-by-day itinerary builder, gallery manager, inclusions/exclusions, featured and best-selling flags, one-click publish/unpublish. |
| **Destinations** | Full CRUD, including an inline parks/regions editor and a month-picker for seasons. |
| **Blog posts** | Full CRUD with cover image, tags and reading time. |
| **Testimonials** | Full CRUD with star ratings and featured flag. |
| **FAQs** | Full CRUD, grouped and ordered. |
| **Enquiries** | Inbox for both form types. Opening marks as read; status can be moved through the workflow. |
| **Site settings** | Edits the homepage hero, the values strip, the full contact block, social links, footer text and default SEO — so nothing on the landing page is hardcoded. |

Images can be entered as a path already in this repo (`/images/…`) or uploaded from the browser;
uploads are stored and served by the API, not by this app.

  Deep Dive ($450), The Pattern of the Bush ($320), Big Five Express ($250), Savanna Sunsets ($200),
  Wilderness Quick-Dive ($300)

**Written for this site, not by Lekker Tours — review before it faces customers:**

- **15 additional tours**, and **every itinerary, duration and price** on all 21 tours. Parks,
  routes and seasons are real and researched, but the commercial detail is illustrative.
- **All 5 destination guides** and their park descriptions.
- **All 5 blog articles** and **all 9 FAQ answers**.
- **All 6 testimonials are illustrative examples, not real customers.** They exist to show how
  genuine reviews will render. Replace them with real, attributable reviews before launch —
  publishing invented testimonials as real would mislead customers.

Design and layout take structural inspiration from bluelilactours.com. No text, images, branding or
logo were copied from it.

Photographs are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) under the Pexels License, with every
photographer credited in [public/images/CREDITS.md](public/images/CREDITS.md). They are stock images
chosen to match each subject, not photographs of Lekker's own trips, camps or guests — the lodge and
camp images in particular are generic and show no actual partner property.

The logo is the one supplied in the original project folder.

## Deployment

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the deployed API hostname, and the API's `WEB_ORIGIN` to this app's
  hostname — CORS and the revalidation webhook both depend on that pair.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` so canonical URLs, the sitemap and robots.txt are correct.
- Keep `REVALIDATE_SECRET` identical on both sides.

### Images from the API

Admin-uploaded media is served by the API, not from this repo, so `<Image>` needs that hostname in
`images.remotePatterns`. [next.config.ts](next.config.ts) derives it from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
rather than hardcoding it, keeping the localhost entries for development. If uploaded images render
in dev but break in production, that pairing is the first thing to check.

## Continuous integration

[.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on push and PR: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`,
`tsc --noEmit`, then `npm run build`. The build deliberately runs **without** an API available —
public pages use `apiGetSafe` / `apiListSafe` and must degrade to an empty state rather than fail,
so a green build also proves that fallback still works.
